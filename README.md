# DeepChess SoC
I try to create an AI Chess playing model based on the paper DeepChess.
It contains two neural nets, Pos2Vec and Siamese network, where the first one is trained unsupervised and the weights acquired are then initialised to Siamese network, which is then trained using Supervised Learning.
It is still in training process and the provisional code is available.
# Future Plans
I will try to make this model stronger by applying reinforcement learning algorithms and self play. But this will surely take time.
